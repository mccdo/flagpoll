Flagpoll
------------------------------
---- Background ----
Flagpoll is a tool for developers to use meta-data files for storing information
on what is needed to compile their software. Think of it as the rpm of software
development. It enables developers total control over which
packages, versions, architectures, etc. that they want to use meta-data from.

---- Use ----
Its usage is almost the same as pkg-config usage with the following additions/considerations.

--- Installation ---
Flagpoll uses Python's distutils for installation. A basic install will look like:
> python setup.py install
This will install to /usr

> python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/install
Using --prefix you can give it a path to install to

> python setup.py bdist_rpm
This will make an rpm that you can install

---- Dependencies ----
Python 2.3 or greater

---- Features ---
* Completely eliminates need for *-config scripts
* Backwards compatible with Pkg-Config .pc files
* Not tied to any software...completely generic
* Smart version lookup(Pkg-Config has "first in list that matches")
   * Able to get newest version of a package and all of its dependencies that work together.
   * Able to get newest point release or patch release of a package and all of its dependencies that work together.
   * Able to cope with multiple architectures, multiple compilers, and parallel software installs
   * Able to filter packages in a more generic arbitrary way
* Relaxed naming conventions on its own file format
* Evaluated file format for incorporation of logic (more about this later)

---- Release ----
To create a release...
1. Update flagpoll.fpc with the appropriate flagpoll version
2. Update the AUTHORS and ChangeLog files 
3. Update the flagpoll.1 with new version info
3. Tag the new revision
