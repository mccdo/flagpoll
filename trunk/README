Flag Poll
------------------------------
---- Background ----
Flag Poll is meant to be a drop in replacement for pkg-config. It was designed to overcome the inherit limitations that pkg-config places on its use. Flag Poll will go far beyond the limits that pkg-config has constrained itself to.

---- Use ----
It is exactly the same as pkg-config usage with the following additions/considerations.

---- Dependencies ----
Python 2.4 or greater

---- Features ---
* Completely eliminates need for *-config scripts
* Backwards compatible with Pkg-Config .pc files
* Not tied to any software...completely generic
* Smart version lookup(Pkg-Config has "first in list that matches")
   * Able to get newest version of a package and all of its dependencies that work together.
   * Able to get newest point release or patch release of a package and all of its dependencies that work together.
   * Able to cope with multiple architectures, multiple compilers, and parallel software installs
   * Able to filter packages in a more generic arbitrary way
* Relaxed naming conventions on its own file format
* Evaluated file format for incorporation of logic (more about this later)
