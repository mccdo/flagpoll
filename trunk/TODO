     TODO List:
-----------------------
- Better arg parsing for more complicated syntax (--exists a < 2.0 b < 3.2 )
- RPM and build that creates the neccesary flagpoll dirs for .fpc files
   - Install our .fpc files too
- Build that will let you add additional directories to search
- Make a man page for unix use
- Build system work(make dirs that aren't there, etc)
