Flagpoll is a tool for developers to use meta-data files for storing information on what is needed to compile their software.


= Using Flagpoll With VR Juggler =

When using flagpoll with VR Juggler it is necessary for the flagpoll aclocal files to be accessible to the VR Juggler build. If you install flagpoll in a default location (e.g. /usr/local, /usr,...) the files can be found automatically. If you install flagpoll in a non-standard location you need to set the ACLOCAL_FLAGS environment variable to include the flagpoll aclocal files. Here is an example:
{{{
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I <location where you installed flagpoll>/share/aclocal" 
}}}
or
{{{
setenv ACLOCAL_FLAGS "-I <location where you installed flagpoll>/share/aclocal" 
}}}
